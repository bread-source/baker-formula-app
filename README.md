# Baker's Formula App
A simple application for calculating measurements

### Development
The build system is Parcel, to run the dev environment use the following

```
npm run dev
```

### Deploy
I'm lazy and didn't want to make this pretty, so the build goes directly in the root
directory so that GitHub pages picks it up.

Run the following to build, then push to master:
```
npm run build
```
